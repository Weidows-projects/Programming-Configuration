# PoShFuck
PowerShell implementation of "The Fuck" (https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck)

When you type a command incorrectly, don't _say_ 'fuck', _type_ it!

## Installation:

For PoShFuck to run, your execution policy must be lowered. So run this in an admin elevated PowerShell to install:

	Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
	iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattparkes/PoShFuck/master/Install-TheFucker.ps1'))

## Usage:

We've all done this before...

	PS C:\> peng 8.8.8.8 -a
	peng : The term 'peng' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.
	Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.
	At line:1 char:1
	+ peng 8.8.8.8 -a
	+ ~~~~
		+ CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (peng:String) [], CommandNotFoundException
		+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException

PoShFuck can fix it.

	PS C:\> fuck
